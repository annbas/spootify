# Playing with Spotify data
This repo contains code that is used to analyze Spotify data.

## File Structure
`workbook` directory: contains directories organized by date (YYYYMMDD). Each directory holds scrap code and images from that work session. 

`data` directory: contains data used in analysis. Currently only holds a year's worth of personal streaming history as requested from Spotify. All other data for this project is pulled from Spotify's API.
